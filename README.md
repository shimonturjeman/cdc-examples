# Change Data Capture (CDC) Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating how to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) solutions using a variety of tools and technologies. CDC allows real-time tracking of changes in a database, enabling data synchronization across systems and real-time reactions to data updates.

## Overview

Each example in this repository shows how to capture changes in a source database and stream them to a target system for data processing, replication, or other real-time use cases.

## Prerequisites

To run the examples, you'll need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Any additional tools specified in the individual example's folder

## Running the Examples

Each example includes detailed steps in its own `README.md` file. Typically, you'll use Docker Compose to set up and run the necessary services. Please refer to the individual example folder for configuration and setup instructions.
